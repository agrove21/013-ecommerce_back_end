## Description
In this challenge, I built the back end for an e-commerce site. I took a working Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a PostgreSQL database. This project helped me deepen my understanding of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) and how databases are managed in an e-commerce environment.
